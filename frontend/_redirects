# Cloudflare Pages Redirects
# This file tells Pages how to handle routing for the SPA

# Static assets should be served as-is (no redirect)
# These patterns must come BEFORE the catch-all /hub/* rule

# All /hub/* routes should serve hub.html (SPA fallback)
# BUT exclude static assets (JS, CSS, images, etc.)
/hub/*  /hub.html  200

# Exclude static assets from the redirect (they should be served directly)
# Note: Cloudflare Pages will serve these files directly if they exist
# The order matters - more specific rules should come first, but since
# we can't use negative patterns, we need a different approach

# Root should serve index.html (chat app)
/  /index.html  200
