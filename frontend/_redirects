# Cloudflare Pages Redirects
# This file tells Pages how to handle routing for the SPA
# IMPORTANT: Cloudflare Pages serves existing files BEFORE applying redirects
# So /hub/hub-app.js and /hub/hub-styles.css will be served directly if they exist

# Root should serve index.html (chat app)
/  /index.html  200

# All /hub/* routes should serve hub.html (SPA fallback)
# Static files (hub-app.js, hub-styles.css) exist in filesystem and will be served directly
/hub/*  /hub.html  200
